SCGI for Perl 6
-----------------

This is a simple SCGI library for Perl 6.

It's main influences are the Perl 5 SCGI library, and the
Perl 6 HTTP::Daemon library.

It offers a bit of candy coating compared to the Perl 5 version.

The environment contains three special keys:

  Request.SCGI is a reference to the SCGI object itself.
  Request.Object is a reference to the individual request object.
  Request.Body is the actual request body (usually from an HTTP POST.)

Also, you don't need to create your own IO::Socket::INET object.
Just pass an 'addr' and 'port' attribute to the new() declaration and it'll
create the object for you.

Oh yeah, and instead of using the while loop as shown on the Perl 5 SCGI
documentation, there is a convenience method called 'handle' that does
the heavy lifting for you:



  use SCGI;

  my $scgi = SCGI.new( :addr<localhost> :port(8080) );

  my $handler = sub (%env) {
    my $name = %env<QUERY_STRING> // 'world';
    my $response = "Content-Type: text/plain\n\n";
    $response ~= "Hello $name\n";
    return $return;
  }

  $scgi.handle: $handler;



Yeah, that's it. A simple SCGI script.
